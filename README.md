# API Security Gateway

A basic API Security Gateway built with FastAPI that demonstrates centralized security features such as authentication, rate limiting, and logging. This project is a work-in-progress and will be incrementally updated as new features are added.

## Project Structure

```
api_gateway_project/
├── main.py         # Application entry point: sets up FastAPI, registers middleware, and includes routes.
├── middleware.py   # Contains middleware logic for authentication, rate limiting, and logging.
├── routes.py       # Defines API endpoints.
├── config.py       # Stores configuration settings (API keys, rate limit parameters, backend URL, etc.).
├── requirements.txt# Lists project dependencies.
└── README.md       # Project documentation.
```

## Features

- **Authentication:**  
  Validates an API key provided in the request headers (`x-api-key`).

- **Rate Limiting:**  
  Limits each client IP to 5 requests per minute.

- **Logging:**  
  Logs incoming requests with details such as method and URL.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd api_gateway_project
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Activate on macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # Activate on Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

5. **Access the API:**
   Open your browser or API client and visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

## Usage

- **Authentication:**  
  Include the API key in your request header:
  ```
  x-api-key: secret123
  ```

- **Rate Limiting:**  
  Each client is limited to 5 requests per minute.

## Future Enhancements

- **Request Forwarding:**  
  Forward validated requests to a backend API.

- **Advanced Authentication:**  
  Implement JWT-based authentication for improved security.

- **Admin Dashboard:**  
  Develop a dashboard to monitor logs and manage settings.

- **Persistent Storage:**  
  Replace in-memory rate limiting with a persistent storage solution (e.g., Redis or a database).
